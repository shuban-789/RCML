# RCML

Really Cool Math Library (RCML) is a mathematics library that aims to provide functions for Rust and C/C++ programs requiring advanced mathematical computations. Supports calculations in areas such as single-variable and multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and more.

This library has implementations for subjects ranging from multiivariable calculus to whatever I find interesting

> NOTE:
> Limits and any limit dependent function will not be perfectly correct but extremely close to the correct value due to the way they are calculated. A standard convention for tolerance may be used in the future. Integration follows Simpson's Rule calculation as of now.
